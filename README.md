# Playwright Project

This repository contains an end-to-end testing suite using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a Node.js library that allows automation for web browsers. The suite is designed to test the functionalities and performance of the web application across different browsers and devices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Playwright allows you to run tests in different browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can also test in headless mode, which is faster and useful for CI environments.

### Explanation:
- **tests/**: Contains all Playwright test cases.
- **playwright.config.js**: Configurations for running Playwright tests (browser settings, timeouts, etc.).
- **package.json**: Contains the project’s dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

## Available Scripts

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- **Run a specific test**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test <test-file-name>
  ```

- **Show Playwright UI** (for debugging):
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --ui
  ```

- **Generate a new test**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright codegen <url>
  ```

- **Run tests with a specific browser**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium  # For Chromium
  npx playwright test --project=firefox   # For Firefox
  npx playwright test --project=webkit    # For WebKit
  ```

- **Run tests in headless mode**:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headless
  ```

## Running Tests

Playwright offers a flexible and powerful testing environment. You can run your tests against multiple browsers and devices, configure them for different environments, and easily debug failures.

By default, Playwright runs tests in parallel to speed up the process. You can customize the settings in the `playwright.config.js` file to fit your project's needs.

## Configuration

The configuration file (`playwright.config.js`) allows you to specify settings such as:

- Browser types: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- Viewport size
- Headless vs. non-headless mode
- Test timeouts
- Test retries
- Base URL for the application under test

You can modify the config file to suit your project’s requirements.
